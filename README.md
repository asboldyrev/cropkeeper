## About CropKeeper

CropKeeper is a web application for managing a home garden. With CropKeeper, users can keep track of what plants they have, where they're located, and when they need to be watered or harvested. The app also provides a planting calendar and alerts users when it's time to sow seeds or transplant seedlings. In addition, CropKeeper allows multiple users to collaborate on a single garden, and supports notifications to remind users of upcoming tasks.
